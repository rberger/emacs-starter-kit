# setup
Install bitlbee.  If on mac, you can use macports.
You will be asked to cp the basic config:
    $ sudo cp /opt/local/etc/bitlbee/bitlbee.conf.sample /opt/local/etc/bitlbee/bitlbee.conf

Make sure you load bitlbee.el
I do this by putting it in .emacs.d/<user>

Link to ~/.emacs.d/vendor/mudphone/bitlbee.conf from ~/.bitlbee/bitlbee.conf

If you already have bitlbee on another machine, you can copy your 
~/.bitlbee/<user>.xml file.  This will allow you to port your account info.

# First time:

## start bitlbee
M-x bitlbee-start

## use ERC to connect
M-x erc
Then, enter...
  host: localhost
  port: 6667
  and your user and password

# After the first time:

## You can start with this (if you're using my keybindings):
    C-c i

# register your user:
ERC> register <password>

# after you are registered, then next time you connect
#   you can get your settings back:
ERC> identify <password>

# add a gmail account to your list:
ERC> account add jabber <user>@gmail.com <password> talk.google.com:5223:ssl

You may get this warning... someone in the world probably knows
  what to do about it...
# Warning: Passing a servername/other flags to `account add' is now
         deprecated. Use `account set' instead.

# add yahoo account:
ERC> account add yahoo <user> <password>
Note: no need for @yahoo.com (in fact you'll get an error if you use it)

# for a list of accounts you have set up:
ERC> account list

# to connect with one account only:
ERC> account on <num>

# to connect to all accounts:
ERC> account on

# to delete an account:
ERC> account del <num>

# save your settings:
ERC> save

# for help
ERC> help

# other helpful things
## full listing of users
ERC> /WHO

## start a chat with user in separate buffer
ERC> /QUERY <user>

## Others:
/whois <user>  # => gives status and network of a user
/names         # => list connected users
<first letter(s) of user name><tab>  # => will complete the user name
