# setup
Install bitlbee.  If on mac, you can use macports.

Make sure you load bitlbee.el
I do this by putting it in .emacs.d/<user>

# start bitlbee
M-x bitlbee-start

# use ERC to connect
M-x erc
Then, enter...
  host: localhost
  port: 6667
  and your user and password

# register your user:
register <password>

# after you are registered, then next time you connect you can get your settings back:
identify <password>

# add a gmail account to your list:
account add jabber <user>@gmail.com <password> talk.google.com:5223:ssl

# Warning: Passing a servername/other flags to `account add' is now
         deprecated. Use `account set' instead.

# add yahoo account:
account add yahoo <user> <password>
Note: no need for @yahoo.com (in fact you'll get an error if you use it)

# for a list of accounts you have set up:
account list

# to connect with one account only:
account on <num>

# to connect to all accounts:
account on

# to delete an account: 
account del <num>

# save your settings:
save

# for help
help

# other helpful things
## full listing of users

## start a chat with user
